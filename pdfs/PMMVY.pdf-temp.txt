About Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) 
The Government of India is implementing the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) with 
effect from 1st January 2017. The PMMVY Scheme is being implemented as per provisions under 
Section 4 of the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 which provides for financial support for 
pregnant and lactating mothers to improve the health and nutrition for mother and child as well as 
compensation for wage loss, if any.   
Objectives of the PMMVY 
The objectives of the PMMVY are to provide cash incentive for partial compensation for the wage loss 
so that the woman can take adequate rest before and after delivery of the ﬁrst child; and to promote 
health-seeking behaviour amongst the Pregnant Women & Lactating Mothers (PW&LM). It envisages 
payment of maternity beneﬁt of ₹5,000/- in beneficiary’s bank/post office account linked to her 
Aadhaar in DBT mode. The eligible beneﬁciary is entitled to receive the remaining cash incentive as 
per approved norms towards Maternity Beneﬁt under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) after institutional 
delivery so that on an average, a woman gets ₹6000/-. All Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers 
(PW&LM) who were eligible as beneficiaries under this programme as on 01stJanuary 2017 are being 
enrolled. 
Scheme aims to cover women belonging to socially, economically disadvantaged and marginalized 
sections of society. Further, as per the new guidelines for 'Mission Shakti’, applicable with effect from 
01.04.2022, the scheme (PMMVY 2.0) seeks to promote positive behavioural change towards girl child 
by providing additional cash incentive for the second child, if that is a girl child. Thus, for the second 
child, the beneﬁt of ₹6000 is to be provided in one instalment post birth. This would contribute 
towards improving Sex Ratio at Birth by discouraging female foeticide. Also, in case of 
miscarriage/stillbirth, the beneﬁciary will be treated as a fresh beneficiary in the event of any future 
pregnancy.  
Main Features of PMMVY (with effect from 1st April 2022) 
PMMVY aims to provide cash benefit to the pregnant women and lactating mothers for first child and 
second child, if girl child, through DBT mode. This cash transfer was introduced for partial wage loss 
compensation and to promote health seeking behaviour among pregnant and lactating mother

Mission Shakti. The fundamental difference between PMMVY launched in 2017 (PMMVY 1.0) and 
revised PMMVY under Mission Shakti (PMMVY 2.0) with effect from 01 April 2022 is as under: 
1. For the first living child, the amount of ₹5000/- will be given in two instalments (₹3000/- and
